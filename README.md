# Keyword Arguments in Java
1st PAVA Project
## Compilation
Using ant, you only need to run:
```ant```
## Execution
```java -jar keyConstructors.jar <Test>```
## Note regarding Extension "Support repeated keywords in method calls with appropriate semantics."
Since the beggining of the project we thought about this extension, without really considering it as an extension.<br>
So this feature was integrated in the original code. You can check it [here] ()
